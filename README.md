These are notebooks for MTH335 at CSI.

They cover (and borrow) material from Kincaid and Cheney's *Numerical Analysis* text, 3rd edition.


The computer examples are written for Julia v0.6. Minor changes would be necessary to use them with v0.7 or v1.0. the "Binder" link *should* allow one live access to thecomputer examples.
