<h1>Floating point numbers</h1><h2>Decimal numbers</h2><p>In mathematics we have different types of numbers: Integers, Rationals, Reals, Complex, ...</p><p>For a minute, lets focus on integers.</p><p>There are infinitely many integers mathematically, but only finitely many representable on the computer.</p><p>On the computer there may be more than one storage type for each mathematical type, For example, <code>Julia</code> has <a href="http://julia.readthedocs.org/en/latest/manual/integers-and-floating-point-numbers/">12</a> built in types for integers (signed and unsigned and different storage sizes.)</p><h3></h3><p><code>Int64</code> is typical. <code>Int8</code> has only $256=2^8$ possible values. It uses $-2^7$ to $2^7-1$.</p><p>Internally, the values are kept in binary:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">convert(Int8, 5) |> bits</pre>
<div class="well well-sm">
00000101</div>

<p>The leading $0$ indicates the sign. </p><h3>Binary numbers</h3><p>Binary numbers use powers of $2$, not $10$. So – as you likely know – $1101$ in binary is just $1\cdot 2^0 + 0\cdot 2^1 + 1 \cdot 2^2 + 1\cdot 2^3 = 13$.</p><p>The largest value in <code>Int8</code> would then be $1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 = 127$.</p><h3>Converting binary to decimal</h3><p>It is easy to convert binary to decimal: we just mentally use powers of 2 instead of 10.</p><p>Here is some code:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">x = "1101101100"
out = [ parse(Int, x[length(x) - i])* 2^i for i in 0:(length(x) - 1)]</pre>
<pre class="output">
10-element Array{Int64,1}:
   0
   0
   4
   8
   0
  32
  64
   0
 256
 512</pre>

<p>and we just add</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">sum(out)</pre>
<div class="well well-sm">
876</div>

<h3>Converting decimal in integer to binary</h3><p>Start with an integer $n$. we generate the value of <code>x</code> from left to right. Suppose $n\geq 2$.</p><p>First find $p$ with $2^p \leq n < 2^{p+1}$. The number will have $p+1$ digits, and the left most one will be $1$.</p><p>Then consider $n = n - 2^p$. Apply the same to this. Repeat.</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">n = 27
log2(n) # 4. So x = 1XXXX</pre>
<div class="well well-sm">
4.754887502163468</div>

<pre class="sourceCode julia">n = n - 2^4
log2(n) # 3. So x = 11XXX</pre>
<div class="well well-sm">
3.4594316186372973</div>

<pre class="sourceCode julia">n = n - 2^3
log2(n) # 1 So x = 1101X</pre>
<div class="well well-sm">
1.584962500721156</div>

<pre class="sourceCode julia">n = n - 2^1 ## smaller than 2, so clearly x = 11011</pre>
<div class="well well-sm">
1</div>

<p>and check:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">x = "11011"
sum( parse(Int, x[length(x) - i])* 2^i for i in 0:(length(x) - 1) )</pre>
<div class="well well-sm">
27</div>

<h3>Math with binary numbers</h3><p>Adding two binary numbers follows the usual algorithm with carrying:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">  1101
+ 1011
------
 11000  
</pre>$$(1 + 4 + 8 + 1 +2 + 8 = 16 + 8)$$
<h3>Multiplication</h3><p>In decimal multiplying or dividing  by 10 is easy – add a $0$ or shift the decimal point. Similarly with binary:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">   10101
*     10
--------
   00000
  10101
--------
  101010
</pre><h3>Negative numbers</h3><p>How are negative numbers stored?</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">bits(convert(Int8, 5)),  bits(convert(Int8, -5))</pre>
<pre class="output">
("00000101", "11111011")</pre>

<p>They are quite different!</p><h3>two's complement</h3><p>The storage uses <a href="http://tinyurl.com/855yrz2">two's</a> complements. Basically $-x$ is stored as $2^n-x$.</p><p>We have $n$ bits ($n=8$ in our example, $64$ is typical, though $32$ may be for older machines). Positive numbers use the first $n-1$ which is why there the largest number is $2^{n-1} + 2^{n-2} + \cdots 2 + 1 = 2^n-1$.</p><p>It could be that the last bit could just be a sign bit, but instead of that, the values for negative numbers are stored in a different format. $-x$ ($x>0$) is stored as $2^n-x$.</p><h3>Carry</h3><pre class="sourceCode julia">bits(convert(Int8, 5)),  bits(convert(Int8, -5))  </pre>
<pre class="output">
("00000101", "11111011")</pre>

<pre class="sourceCode julia">11111111    (Carry)
 00000101   (5=1*1 + 0*2 + 1*4)
 11111011   (2^8-5 = 251 = 1 + 2 + 8 + 16+32 + 64 +128
---------
100000000
</pre><h3>Why</h3><p>This makes addition easy, as illustrated above. Or here with 15 + (-5)</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">11111111    (Carry)
 00001111   (15=1*1 + 1*2 + 1*4+1*8)
 11111011   (2^8-5 = 251 = 1 + 2 +...+ 64 +128
---------
100001010
</pre><p>And <code>00001010</code> $ = 2 + 8 = 10$.</p><h3>multiplying and shifting</h3><p>Let's see what happens with powers of 2:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">bits(2)</pre>
<div class="well well-sm">

<h2>Decimal numbers</h2><p>On a calculator there is one basic number type: floating point. This is primarily the case with computers as well.</p><p>In mathematics we primarily work with <em>decimal numbers</em></p>$$~
12.34 = 1 \cdot 10^2 + 2 \cdot 10^1 + 3\cdot 10^{-1} + 4 \cdot 10^{-2}
~$$
<h3>Scientific notation</h3><p>We can write a real number in terms of powers of 10. For example:</p>$$~
1.234 = 1.234 \cdot 10^0 =  12.34 \cdot 10^{-1} =  .1234 \cdot 10^1 = \cdots
~$$
<p>We can use normalized scientific notation to say that we can express $x$ by three quantities:</p>$$~
x = \pm r \cdot 10^n
~$$
<ul>
<li><p>The $\pm$ is $+1$ or $-1$ and records the sign of $x$</p>
</li>
<li><p>the $r$ is a number in $0.1 \leq r < 1.0$</p>
</li>
<li><p>the $n$ is an integer, possibly negative, or zero.</p>
</li>
</ul><h2>scientific notation with different bases</h2><p>We can use different bases in scientific notation. A number would be represented with</p>$$~
x = \pm q \cdot \beta^m
~$$
<p>We can normalize the number by insisting $q=0.ddddd...$ where the leading term is non-zero.</p><p>A special case would be $\beta =2$ or base 2, which forces the leading term to be 1. In that case, a special case could be $q=1.dddddd...$.</p><h3>Converting decimal to binary</h3><p>We can convert decimal numbers to binary. The same simple algorithm for integers works with some modification. Start with $x$. We want to produce digits $ddd.ddd...$ where $d$ are either $0$ or $1$.</p><p>First, take the log base 2:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">x = 12.1
log2(x) |> floor</pre>
<div class="well well-sm">
3.0</div>

<p>This says $2^3 \leq x < 2^4$. Remember $3$, then subtract $2^3$ and repeat:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">ds = [3]
x = x - 2.0^ds[end]
n = log2(x) |> floor</pre>
<div class="well well-sm">
2.0</div>

<p>Remember 2 and then subtract $2^2$ and repeat:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">push!(ds, n)
x = x - 2.0^ds[end]
n = log2(x) |> floor</pre>
<div class="well well-sm">
-4.0</div>

<p>Remember $-4$ and repeat</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">push!(ds, n)
x = x - 2.0^ds[end]
n = log2(x) |> floor</pre>
<div class="well well-sm">
-5.0</div>

<p>etc.</p><p>The <code>ds</code> will tell us there is a 1 in position 3,2,-4, -5, 8,9... So <code>1100.000110011...</code></p><p>One thing to note: what numbers terminate in decimal are generally different than what numbers will terminate in binary.</p><h2>Floating point numbers</h2><p>Floating point is a representation of numbers using scientific notation. Only there are constraints on the sizes:</p><ul>
<li><p>The value $q$, the significand, has $p$ digits. (The precision)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The values of $m$ is between two values, say $e_{min}$ and $e_{max}$.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>A simple case</h3><p>For example consider base $\beta=10$, $p=3$ and $e_{min}=-1$ and $e_{max}=2$. Then the possible values are limited to $-9.99 \cdot 10^{-1}$ to $9.99 \cdot 10^2$. How many are there?</p>$$~
2 \cdot ((\beta-1)\cdot\beta^{p-1}) \cdot (e_{max} - e_{min})
~$$
<h2>Binary floating point</h2><p>For binary floating point, things are similar. For <em>simplicity</em> let's look at 16-bit floating point where</p><ul>
<li><p>1 bit is the sign bit <code>0</code> = $+1$, <code>1</code> is $-1$</p>
</li>
<li><p>the $q$ is represented with $10$ bits (the <em>precision</em> is 10)</p>
</li>
<li><p>the $m$ is represented with $5$ bits.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>There is nothing to represent the <em>sign</em> of $m$. The trick is offset the value by subtracting and using  $m -15$.</p><p>With this, can we represent some numbers:</p><p>What is $1$? It is $+1 \cdot 1.0 \cdot 10^{15 - 15}$. So we should have</p><ul>
<li><p>the sign is <code>0</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>the $q$ is <code>0000000000</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>the $m$ is <code>01111</code></p>
</li>
</ul><p>Checking we have</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">convert(Float16, 1.0) |> bits</pre>
<div class="well well-sm">
0011110000000000</div>

<h3></h3><p>Kinda hard to see: Let's wrap this in a function:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">function seebits(x)

  b[1:1], b[2:6], b[7:end]
end</pre>
<pre class="output">

<pre class="sourceCode julia">seebits(1)</pre>
<pre class="output">
("0", "01111", "0000000000")</pre>

<h3></h3><p>We have $2 = 1.0 \cdot 2^1$. Se we expect $q$ to represent $0$ and $m$ to represent $16$, as $16-15 = 1$:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">seebits(2)</pre>
<pre class="output">
("0", "10000", "0000000000")</pre>

<p>What about the sign bit?</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">seebits(-2)</pre>
<pre class="output">
("1", "10000", "0000000000")</pre>

<h3></h3><p>What about other numbers</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">seebits(1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 0/16 + 1/32)</pre>
<pre class="output">

<pre class="output">
("0", "10011", "1110100000")</pre>

<h2>Zero and other "special" numbers</h2><p>Wait a minute – if we insist on the significand being $1.dddd...$ we can't represent $0$!</p><p>Some values in floating point are special:</p><ul>
<li><p>What is $0$? how to write $0$ in $1.dddd \cdot 2^m$? Can't do it. So it is coded:</p>
</li>
</ul><pre class="sourceCode julia">bits(zero(Float16))</pre>
<div class="well well-sm">
0000000000000000</div>

<p>(The code uses the <em>smallest</em> possible exponent, and $0$ for the significand)</p><ul>
<li><p>What is $-0$? By flipping the sign bit, we could code $-0$ naturally. Is it done?</p>
</li>
</ul><pre class="sourceCode julia">bits(-zero(Float16))   ## why??</pre>
<div class="well well-sm">
1000000000000000</div>

<h3>"Infinity": Inf</h3><p>Infinity. <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/Infinity.pdf">Why</a>?</p><p>This value is deemed valuable to have supported at the hardware level. It is coded by reserving the <em>largest</em> possible value of $m$ and $0$ for the significand.</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">bits(Inf16)  </pre>
<div class="well well-sm">
0111110000000000</div>

<p>There is room for $-\infty$ and it too is defined:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">bits(-Inf16)</pre>
<div class="well well-sm">
1111110000000000</div>

<h3>Not a number: NaN</h3><p>NaN. This is a special value reserved for computations where no value is possible. Examples include <code>0/0</code> or <code>0 * Inf</code>:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">0/0, 0 * Inf</pre>
<pre class="output">
(NaN, NaN)</pre>

<p>These are related to limit problems (indeterminate), though not all forms are indeterminate:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">1/0, 0^0</pre>
<pre class="output">
(Inf, 1)</pre>

<p>How is <code>NaN</code> coded:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">bits(NaN16)</pre>
<div class="well well-sm">
0111111000000000</div>

<p>This is <em>very</em> similar to <code>Inf</code>, but the value of $q$ is non-zero!</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">seebits(NaN16), seebits(Inf16)</pre>
<pre class="output">
(("0", "11111", "1000000000"), ("0", "11111", "0000000000"))</pre>

<p><code>NaN</code> semantics are a bit <a href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/7866">controversial</a>.</p><h3>Poison</h3><p>The values of <code>Inf</code> and <code>NaN</code> will "poison" subsequent operations, for example</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">NaN + 1, Inf - 1</pre>
<pre class="output">
(NaN, Inf)</pre>

<p>These special values are generated instead of errors being thrown for some common cases:</p><ul>
<li><p>overflow (a number bigger than the largest finite floating point number)</p>
</li>
<li><p>divide by $0$ (either <code>Inf</code>, or if <code>0/0</code>, <code>NaN</code>)</p>
</li>
<li><p>invalid number (such as <code>0 * Inf</code>)</p>
</li>
</ul><p>(Whether something like <code>sqrt&#40;-1.0&#41;</code> is an error or <code>NaN</code> is not specified.)</p><h3>Range of numbers</h3><p>What is the range of the numbers that can be represented? Let's check with Float16.</p><p>The largest <em>positive</em> value would have $m$ coded with <code>11110</code> or ($2 + 4 + 8 + 16 - 15 = 15$) (The value <code>11111</code> is saved for <code>Inf</code> and <code>NaN</code>.)</p><p>The largest value for $q$ would be <code>1111111111</code>, or</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">sum([1/2^i for i in 0:10])</pre>

1.9990234375</div>

<p>Altogether we have:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">sum([1//2^i for i in 0:10]) * 2^15</pre>
<div class="well well-sm">
65504//1</div>

<p>Is this right?</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">prevfloat(typemax(Float16))</pre>
<div class="well well-sm">
6.55e4</div>

<p>For the smallest <em>positive</em> number, the smallest exponent is code <code>00000</code> or $0 - 15 = -15$. So the value should be:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">1/2^15</pre>
<div class="well well-sm">
3.0517578125e-5</div>

<p>But this isn't actually the case:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">nextfloat(convert(Float16, 0))</pre>
<div class="well well-sm">
6.0e-8</div>

<p>(As there are tricks to get smaller numbers called subnormal numbers)</p><p>For double precision numbers (Float64) the values are given by:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">prevfloat(Inf), nextfloat(0.0)</pre>
<pre class="output">
(1.7976931348623157e308, 5.0e-324)</pre>

<h2>Rounding</h2><p>We are familiar with the task of rounding: a passing grade is 59.5 not a 60!</p><p>We have three types of rounding: round up, round down, mixing based on a rule.</p><p>Rounding to the nearest integer shows this fairly clearly:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">x = 3.14
ceil(x), floor(x), round(x)</pre>
<pre class="output">
(4.0, 3.0, 3.0)</pre>

<p>The same would be true of $3.1$, as that is all that is looked at here.</p><p>What becomes of $1.5$? The default is to round up.</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">x = 1.5
ceil(x), floor(x), round(x)</pre>
<pre class="output">
(2.0, 1.0, 2.0)</pre>

<p>Rounding can be done for real numbers too to some specified number of digits:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">x = 1.23456
round(x,1), round(x,2), round(x,4)</pre>
<pre class="output">
(1.2, 1.23, 1.2346)</pre>

<h3>Rounding in floating point</h3><p>When converting from decimal to floating point, even simple decimal numbers get rounded!</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">convert(Float16, 0.1)</pre>
<div class="well well-sm">
0.1</div>

<pre class="sourceCode julia">seebits(0.1)</pre>
<pre class="output">
("0", "01011", "1001100110")</pre>

<p>"1001100110" becomes:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">q = (1 + 1/2 + 1/16 + 1/32 + 1/256 + 1/512 )</pre>
<div class="well well-sm">
1.599609375</div>

<h3></h3><p>And <code>01011</code> for $m$ becomes</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">m = 2.0^(1 + 2 + 8 - 15)</pre>
<div class="well well-sm">
0.0625</div>

<pre class="sourceCode julia">1 * q * 2^m</pre>
<div class="well well-sm">
1.6704301324376012</div>

<p>Notice the number $0.1$ is necessarily approximated.</p><h3>Error bound</h3><p>Let $x$ be the number and $\tilde{x}$ be its rounded value. How big is the difference when $x$ is rounded to $n$ decimal places?</p><p>We consider the value of the $n+1$st decimal number.</p><ul>
<li><p>If it is in 0,1,2,3,4 then we round down and the error is $i \cdot 10^{-(n+1)}$</p>
</li>
<li><p>If it is in 5,6,7,8,9 then we round up, and the error is $10-i \cdot 10^{-(n+1)}$.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In either case, it is less –in absolute value – than $(10/2) \cdot 10^{-(n+1)} = 1/2 \cdot 10^{-n}$.</p><blockquote>
<p>The error in rounding to $n$ decimal points is bounded by: $|x - \tilde{x}| < 1/2 \cdot 10^{-n}$.</p>
</blockquote><p>Had we chopped (<code>floor</code>) or always rounded up (<code>ceil</code>) then the error is bounded by $10^{-n}$.</p><h3>Ulp</h3><p>There is an alternate name for the error. When rounding to a certain number of digits, there is a unit of last precision, and <code>ulp</code>. In the above, the unit of last precision was $10^{-n}$, so the error is less than $1/2$ <code>ulp</code>.</p><p><code>ulp</code>s are easy enough to understand. If we round $3.1415$ to $3.14$ then the error is $0.15$ <code>ulp</code>.</p><h3>How much off can rounding be?</h3><p>In binary floating point, the unit of last precision is $2^{-p}$, so the error in rounding is at most $(1/2) \cdot 2^{-p}$, or half an <code>ulp</code>.</p><h3>Float16, Float32, Float64, ...</h3><p>16-bit floating point is not typical. What is common is:</p><ul>
<li><p>64-bit floating point (in Julia <code>Float64</code>)</p>
</li>
<li><p>32-bit floating point (older hardward and OSes)</p>
</li>
</ul><p>How the bits are arranged in IEEE 754 binary formats for <a href="http://tinyurl.com/76kpk6s">floating point</a> we have this <a href="http://tinyurl.com/76kpk6s">table</a>. See also this post by John <a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2009/04/06/anatomy-of-a-floating-point-number/">Cook</a> for the common case.</p><p>For example</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">b = bits(2^2 + 2^0 + 1/2 + 1/8) ## 101.101 = 1.01101 * 2^2
b[1:1], b[2:12], b[13:end]</pre>
<pre class="output">
("0", "10000000001", "0110100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000")</pre>

<p>Here $m = 2^{10} + 1 - (2^{10} - 1)$ and we can see that $q=1.01101$ with the first $1$ implicit.</p><h2>Machine numbers</h2><p>The numbers that can be represented <strong>exactly</strong> in floating point are called <em>machine numbers</em>.</p><p>| There aren't very many compared to the <strong>infinite</strong> number of floating point values.</p><p>Let's visualize in a <em>hypothetical</em> Float8 mode with 1 sign bit, 3 exponent bits and 4 bits for the mantissa.</p><p>The possible <em>positive</em> values are</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">qs = [1 + i/2 + j/4 + k/8 + l/16 for i in 0:1, j in 0:1, k in 0:1, l in 0:1] |> vec |> sort</pre>
